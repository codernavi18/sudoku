# Augmented reality Sudoku solver

This code is a C++ code to solve Sudokus in real time from the webcam feed. It detects the Sudoku, recognizes the digits, solves it, and projects the result back onto the image via augmented reality.

The algorithm is not optimal in many senses, but it's thought for educational purposes, to try to help computer vision non-experts understand some of the concepts behind the algorithms.

You can find a step-by-step explanation in [my blog](http://jponttuset.github.io/solving-sudokus-like-a-pro-1/).

I hope you enjoy it!

PS: So far the code only gets to the point of locating the Sudoku grids, I'll post the whole code soon.
