# Augmented reality Sudoku solver

This code is a C++ code to solve Sudokus in real time from the webcam feed. It detects the Sudoku, recognizes the digits, solves it, and projects the result back onto the image via augmented reality. It uses [OpenCV](http://opencv.org).

The algorithm is not optimal in many senses, but it's thought for educational purposes, to try to help computer vision non-experts understand some of the concepts behind the algorithms.

You can find a step-by-step explanation in two posts in my blog: [First](http://jponttuset.github.io/solving-sudokus-like-a-pro-1/), and [second](http://jponttuset.github.io/solving-sudokus-like-a-pro-2/).
You can also find a demo video [here](https://youtu.be/OnASlP1SFX0).

To compile, you have to install [OpenCV](http://opencv.org) and link against it.

I hope you enjoy it, and please say hi in the blog if you used it! :)
